#Task 1

There are n (input by user) distinct words. 
First, the user is asked to enter the total number of words they wish to enter.
Then the user is asked to enter whichever words they want, same or distinct, 'n' number of times.
for loop is used to repeat the process 'n' number of times.
The distinct words are stored in list l1() and total words are stored in list l()

As the 1st line of the output we print the number of elements in list l1 which is the number of distinct words.
for loop is used again to count the number of times a word is present in list l.
We then print the required output in the 2nd line.
'end' is used so that it gets printed in the same line.

Thus, the 1st task is completed.
